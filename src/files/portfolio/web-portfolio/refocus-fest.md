My theater company, [[redacted]](http://www.redactedtheater.org) was invited to co-produce and take part in a new festival exploring questions of privilege alongside three other Philadelphia-based artists. I designed the website and developed it with icon design from [Vanessa Ogbuehi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vogbuehi/).
