I was [Amino Payments](https://www.aminopay.com)' first full-time frontend hire, coming into the company as employee #20. I inherited an MVP-style product and added many new features while simultaneously cleaning it up and making it more extensible and driven by best practices. I spearheaded bringing end-to-end testing to our codebase. In addition to developing a set of data visualizations for a new dashboard, I supported the sales team by spinning up demo sites for potential clients, complete with data to fit their use case.
