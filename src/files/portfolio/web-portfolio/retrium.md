I began my time as a Software Engineer at [Retrium](https://www.retrium.com), employee #16, eventually rising to the position of Staff Software Engineer. Working with a real-time collaborative product, I helped cross-functional teams craft major new features in a myriad of ways - from prototyping user experiences, to planning large chunks of work, to writing code. I facilitated regular retrospectives and refined our development processes to continually improve the team. Additionally, I ran the hiring process for the product team, doubling it in size and creating two new positions for the organization.
