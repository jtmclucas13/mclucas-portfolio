Industry-leading provider of IRT software [Suvoda](https://www.suvoda.com) recognized that their process for launching new clinical drug trials was broken. When they launched a new team whose purpose was to launch a platform for extending and customizing their apps, they hired me to help lead the frontend transition. I performed R&D for various approaches to extensibility, including page-level editor frameworks, PWA features, and template-based deployments driven by CLI tools. Alongside this endeavour, I helped create a shared UI library based on Material UI for usage across products.
