As a contractor at [PromptWorks](https://www.promptworks.com/), I collaborated with engineers at [URBN](https://www.urbn.com/) to build the customer-facing app for a new clothing rental service called [Nuuly](https://www.nuuly.com/). I led the PromptWorks team in building the account management, product review, and report a problem sections of the site using Vue. I was responsible for kick-starting their unit testing, as well as managing some third party integrations with services such as Intercom and Braze.
