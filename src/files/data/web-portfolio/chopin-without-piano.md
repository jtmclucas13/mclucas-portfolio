I was hired to create a website for the first American tour of [Chopin Without Piano](http://www.chopinwithoutpiano.com/), a play by Polish theater company [CENTRALA](https://www.centralateatr.pl/en/). This production was supported by major arts grants and [Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu/). My website was intended both to sell tickets and to become an English-language hub for the production. Special attention was given to Lost Pianos, a viral marketing campaign for the production. I was the sole developer on the project, but I collaborated with marketing and content specialists throughout the process to create the ultimate experience.
