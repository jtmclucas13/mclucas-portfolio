I worked for over two years at [Nuix](https://www.nuix.com), an Australia-based digital forensics/cybersecurity company on several different product teams. My initial task was to develop animated graphs and real-time data visualizations for an administration dashboard supporting their enterprise investigation platform. I spent the majority of my time there leading the frontend Orchestration team (3-4 devs) in building a workflow manager. I mentored junior engineers, participated in the hiring process, and guided the overall architecture and direction of the frontend codebase. Nuix's cross team collaboration was unparalleled. I participated in that by spearheading an initiative to create a fully custom live style guide supporting design and development across several teams, as well as serving as one of four maintainers of an internal UI library shared across teams and continents.
