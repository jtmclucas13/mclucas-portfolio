I founded [[redacted] Theater Company](http://www.redactedtheater.org/) in early 2014, and when we were finally ready to launch publicly, I created the website. I integrated WordPress for the blog section, but otherwise hand-coded the site from scratch. This site was one of my first designs, and I am personally responsible for most of the content.
