I founded [[redacted] Theater Company](http://www.redactedtheater.org/) in early 2014, and when we were finally ready to launch publicly, I created the website. The censoring effect found throughout is raw CSS/JavaScript, not a plugin. I'm particularly proud of that effect, as I designed and developed the site by myself and am personally responsible for most of the content.
